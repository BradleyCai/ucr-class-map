/**
 * Class to represent a course. Should be used in a list to represent a schedule.
 * Has functions avaliable to manipulate the data and present things in different ways.
 *
 * There are certain courses that do not have one period of time for one set of days.
 * These courses have multiple times for different days. (ex. One course but Tuesday class
 * meets at 7 where as Thrusday class meets at 8). These special cases are handeled by storing
 * them as two different courses. These two courses are technically one course but to represent
 * them better we have them as 2.
