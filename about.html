                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>All processing and thinking is done on your own computer. Nothing schedule related is sent to us. At all. We have no interest in selling your personal data to advertisers. You can even try disconnecting your internet and entering your data. If you're still skeptical, you can see all the source code on our <a href="https://github.com/BradleyCai/ucr-schedule-visualizer/">GitHub</a>. We do however store your GROWL schedule in a cookie that either expires after 10 years or when you click the button "Visualize Again".

                <br><br>We also collect statistics about who visits our page. The <a href="https://waa.ai/">Akari Link Shortener</a> records the clicks for our <a href= "https://waa.ai/ucrsv">shortened link</a>. The click count can be found <a href="https://stats.waa.ai/ucrsv">here</a>. Also, GitHub collects statistics about our general traffic and that can be found <a href="https://github.com/BradleyCai/ucr-schedule-visualizer/graphs/traffic">here</a>.

                <br><br>Google Calendar integration requires an internet connection 
                in order to send your schedule to Google so that the courses may 
                be added to your calendar as events. For this, Google requires 
                app developers to register for an API key with them and users to 
                authorize the app that corresponds to that API key in order to 
                grant privileges to modify the user's calendar. The API key for 
                this app is registered to <a href="https://github.com/jgome043">
                  Joel Gomez</a> and is only authorized for requests from specific 
                domains.

                <br><br>If you'd like to get your own API key so that you may run 
                this application on your own server, instructions are available 
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/js#step_1_turn_on_the_api_name">
                  here</a>. Simply replace the key in the resources/api.json [file]
                (resources/api.json) with your own, make sure the domain for 
                your project is registered to your key, and you're set.

                <br><br>This app will also make a separate API request to 
                https://ucr-term-dates.appspot.com in order to get the start and 
                end times for every quarter so that the dates for the Google Calendar 
                events are reflective of the quarter's first and last day of 
                instruction for your convenience. This API is also open source 
                and the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/jgome043/ucr-term-dates">here</a>.
                
                <br><br>If we ever change this privacy policy we will announce it on the alert section on the main page. <br><strong>(Last updated: September 27, 2016)</strong></p>
