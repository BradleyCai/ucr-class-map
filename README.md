UCR Schedule Visualizer
=======================

The raw class list from GROWL is pretty ugly. We're here to fix that.

This project is a website written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that generates an
hour by hour view of your schedule as well as provide links to each class location
from the schedule you get from GROWL. Your security and privacy is maintained because
all of the schedule interpreting and viewing is done client side. No personal schedule
related information is sent over the web.

[GitHub Pages](http://bradleycai.github.io/ucr-schedule-visualizer/)
--------------------------------------------------------

This project is hosted on GitHub pages. You can check out the current stable release
of our website using the link above.

Because the GitHub pages branch is the equivalent of a master branch, the gh-pages
branch is our master branch.

We are using the [Akari Link Shortener](https://waa.ai/) to shorten our link. The link is: [https://waa.ai/ucrsv](https://waa.ai/ucrsv) with the
first three characters "ucr" referring to our school name, and the last 2 characters "sv" being short for "schedule visualizer". We also have a QR code
which you can find [here](http://bradleycai.github.io/ucr-schedule-visualizer/img/WAAAI-QR.png).
