UCR Schedule Visualizer
=======================

The raw class list from GROWL is pretty ugly. We're here to fix that.

This project is a website written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript that is meant to generate a calendar hour by hour view of your schedule 
as well as provide links to each class location from the schedule you get from GROWL. Security is ensured because all of the schedule 
interpreting and viewing is done client side. No personal schedule related information is sent over the web.

[GitHub Pages](http://bradleycai.github.io/ucr-class-map/)
--------------------------------------------------------

This project will be hosted for free on GitHub pages. The downside is that you can't do any server side magic. The upside is that the 
website's purpose only really needs client side HTML, CSS, and JS which works out!

You can check out the current stable release of our website via the link above.

Because the GitHub pages branch is the equivilant of a master branch, the gh-pages branch is our master branch.

We are using the [Akari Link Shortener](https://waa.ai/) to shorten our link. The link is: [https://waa.ai/ucrsv](https://waa.ai/ucrsv) with the
first three characters "ucr" refering to our school name, and the last 2 characters "sv" being short for "schedule visualizer". We also have a QR code
which you can find [here](http://bradleycai.github.io/ucr-class-map/img/WAAAI-QR.png).
