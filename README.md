UCR Schedule Calendar Map Viewer
=================================

The raw class list from GROWL is pretty ugly. We can fix that.

This project is a website written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript that is meant to generate a calendar hour by hour view of your schedule 
as well as provide links to each class location from the schedule you get from GROWL. Security is ensured because all of the schedule interpreting and viewing is
done client side. No personal schedule related information is sent over the web.
